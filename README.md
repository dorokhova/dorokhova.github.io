## Welcome to GitHub Pages

My name is Anna, I am a first-year student of two-years "Cognitive Studies" master's program. I have a strong interest in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging. My master’s thesis is "Characteristics of the neural network activity of the human brain associated with social intelligence: Resting state fMRI". 

I would like to deeper understand the value of functional connectivity tools in examining subjects with different levels of social and emotional intelligence, and in examining diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, autism, Williams-Beuren syndrome, developmental language disorder, Tourette syndrome, Down syndrome, and depression. Besides that, I am eager to learn about the sense of self, self-related processing, and the relationship between the self and the resting state activity.

I have some basic programming skills in Matlab and JavaScript. I have completed a course on Cognitive Neurophysiology, a course in Mathematical Statistics (trained in SPSS), and a course in Cognitive Neuropsychology. I have also conducted a trial EEG experiment with a few of my classmates the last semester in the university laboratory.

Knowledge and skills that the Neuromatch school gives will be extremely valuable for working on my master’s thesis and in the future career path. FMRI-data for my research project is already collected. I am eager to deepen my understanding of the connection between the observed BOLD-response and the real neural activity, to learn more about how to approach the data - how to interpret it, how to choose the right models, and analyze the results. 

After completing my master's degree, I hope to do a PhD research where the skills obtained during the school would also be at a great value.
